# 2ndChance
Hack Brooklyn 2021

## Inspiration
We took the idea of this project from LinkedIn where users can browse for jobs online and view their profile and personal information. However, instead of normal users, the target audience here are prisoners.

## What it does
2ndChance connects prisoners to job posts to look for jobs. Their accounts can be monitored by prison administrators where they have full control over prisoner's information and whether they can have an account or not. 

An administrator first registers an account for a specific prisoner by entering the prisoner's personal information such as name, age, criminal ID and etc. then provides username and password for that prisoner. Later, the prisoner can use that username and password to login to his/her account to view profile and browse job posting. However, personal information set by the admin will not be changeable which prevents frauds and misinformation. 

## How we built it
We built this program by using Flask framework for backend and Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS for frontend. The login, user and job information are all stored on a database in Flask while the design and client functionalities of the site are programmed using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges along the way such as adding prisoner information from the admin's dashboard and updating the information on the prisoner's profile. This all stemmed from the challenge of passing data from Flask to HTML and vice versa.
